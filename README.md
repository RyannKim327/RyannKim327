### Brief Introduction About Myself
<blockquote style="text-align: justify;">&emsp;I am Ryann Kim Sesgundo, or RyannKim327, a simple newbie and passionate programmer from Philippines. I'm still trying to break my limitations, by studying different programming languages, which my forte is actually Java. I developed or maybe say rebuild my first android application last April 2018, that gives me a kick up to learn development and improve my logical thinkings. To express and to improve my knowledge. I try to guide some online, that helps me to improve, also to review my knowledge from my past experiences. I was actually focused with the logic of the program, and then, I try to program each of them, based on what idea came to me.</blockquote>
