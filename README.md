# About Me

Greetings, this is RyannKim327, a simple and newbie programmer from Philippines. I was focused on Web Development, mostly in backend with MySql and PHP, and HTML, CSS, JS for front-end. In Application Development, mostly in Java and XML. I'm open for any collaborations, but only for small projects. I already have my own forum site, but the website was down. I also have my own file hosting site. I already make my file hosting with SEO (Search Engine Optimization). I also make a small chatting site, where you can talk with strangers with baybayin. [You will be redirecting to my site by clicking this](https://sulatbaybayin.coolpage.biz).  The development of my projects are all from scratch, means there's no form at first. I catch ideas, from the first build, also from other's idea.

For now, I still learning JQuery, C, C#, C++, and Python. But I currently focusing on Python and C++.
