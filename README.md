## Welcome to RyannKim327's Profile

### Personal Infomation
> Hello, I am Ryann Kim Sesgundo, a so-called developer from Quezon Province. I'm just trying to contribute here not just to backup my codes, but also to share what I've learned. I'm using Java 7 in android development, since I'm using android phone to develop. I use NodeJS to learn more Javascript. I'm also trying some Webscraping thru Python, and some basic programs with other languages. I also try to develop some website using HTML, CSS and Javascript for front-end and PHP, MySQL for backend. I'm still focusing now with python, (GUI and WebScraping). And trying to develop my visualization skills in designing.
